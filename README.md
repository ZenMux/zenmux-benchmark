## Quick Start

### 1. Environment Setup

Set up your ZenMux API key:

```bash
# Set ZenMux API key (required)
export ZENMUX_API_KEY="your_zenmux_api_key"

# Note: Judging also uses ZenMux API, no separate OpenAI API key needed
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
uv sync
```

### 3. Basic Testing (Recommended First Run)

```bash
# Test basic functionality
uv run python example.py

# Small-scale test - text-only questions, 3 samples
uv run python benchmark.py --text-only --max-samples 3

# Test specific model
uv run python benchmark.py --mode single \
  --model-slug openai/gpt-4o-mini \
  --provider-slug openai \
  --text-only --max-samples 10

# Test without judging (prediction only)
uv run python benchmark.py --mode single \
  --model-slug openai/gpt-4o-mini \
  --provider-slug openai \
  --text-only --max-samples 10 \
  --no-judge

# Test all models except expensive ones
uv run python benchmark.py --text-only --max-samples 5 --exclude-model openai/gpt-4o
```

## Core Functionality

### 1. Evaluate All Models

```bash
# Evaluate all available models (takes a long time!)
uv run python benchmark.py --mode all

# Text-only questions only
uv run python benchmark.py --mode all --text-only

# Limit samples for quick testing
uv run python benchmark.py --mode all --text-only --max-samples 10
```

### 2. Evaluate Specific Models

```bash
# Evaluate specific model with specific provider
uv run python benchmark.py --mode single \
  --model-slug deepseek/deepseek-chat \
  --provider-slug deepseek

# The system automatically evaluates all available endpoints for the model
```

### 3. Filtered Evaluation

```bash
# Evaluate all DeepSeek models
uv run python benchmark.py --mode filter --model-filter deepseek --text-only

# Evaluate all Claude models, text-only questions
uv run python benchmark.py --mode filter --model-filter claude --text-only

# Evaluate all models from OpenAI provider
uv run python benchmark.py --mode filter --model-filter openai
```

### 4. Model Exclusion

```bash
# Exclude specific models (all providers for this model)
uv run python benchmark.py --exclude-model openai/gpt-4o anthropic/claude-3-haiku

# Exclude entire vendors (all models from vendor)
uv run python benchmark.py --exclude-model anthropic openai

# Exclude specific provider (all models using this provider)
uv run python benchmark.py --exclude-provider theta

# Exclude specific model from specific provider only
uv run python benchmark.py --exclude-model openai/gpt-4o:openai

# Combine both exclusion types
uv run python benchmark.py --exclude-provider theta \
  --exclude-model google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite:google-vertex anthropic/claude-opus-4.1 \
  --text-only --max-samples 3

# Combine with other options
uv run python benchmark.py --mode filter --model-filter gpt --exclude-model openai/gpt-4o-mini
```

### 5. Failure Recovery

When evaluations encounter failures, you can automatically retry and fix them using concurrent processing:

```bash
# Fix both evaluation and judge failures from a previous run
uv run python benchmark.py --fix results/20250922_093840

# The system will:
# - Read models from available_models_*.json
# - Process multiple models concurrently (up to max_concurrent_models)
# - For each model, fix failed questions concurrently (up to num_workers)
# - Retry evaluation failures first, then judge failures
# - Update files with successful results
# - Recalculate metrics for all models

# Adjust concurrency for fix operations
uv run python benchmark.py --fix results/20250922_093840 --num-workers 5

# The fix mode uses the same dual-layer concurrency as normal evaluation:
# - Outer layer: Multiple models fixed simultaneously
# - Inner layer: Multiple questions per model fixed concurrently
```

## Important Options

### `--text-only`

- Filters out questions containing images, evaluates text-only questions
- Suitable for models that don't support multimodal inputs
- Significantly reduces evaluation time and cost

### `--max-samples N`

- Limits evaluation to the first N questions
- Perfect for testing and debugging
- Recommended to start with small values (3-10)

### `--no-judge`

- Skips automatic judging
- Use when you want to manually score results or just generate predictions

### `--num-workers N`

- Controls concurrent requests per model (inner concurrency)
- Default is 3, adjust based on API rate limits and provider capabilities
- Each model processes questions concurrently with this limit

### `--exclude-model MODEL1 MODEL2 ...`

- Exclude specific models from evaluation
- Supports three matching patterns:
  - **Exact match**: `openai/gpt-4o` (excludes this model from all providers)
  - **Specific provider**: `openai/gpt-4o:openai` (excludes only from OpenAI provider)
  - **Vendor exclusion**: `anthropic` (excludes all models from Anthropic vendor)
- Can combine multiple exclusion patterns

### `--exclude-provider PROVIDER1 PROVIDER2 ...`

- Exclude all models from specific providers
- Examples: `theta`, `openai`, `anthropic`, `google-vertex`
- Useful for excluding all models using a particular provider backend

### `--fix TIMESTAMP_DIR`

- Fix both evaluation and judge failures from a previous run using concurrent processing
- Reads model list from `available_models_*.json`
- Processes multiple models simultaneously (up to `max_concurrent_models`)
- For each model, fixes failed questions concurrently (up to `num_workers`)
- Retries questions with empty responses in prediction files
- Retries judgments with empty judge responses in judge files
- Updates files with successful results and recalculates metrics
- Follows the same evaluation → judge → metrics workflow as normal runs

### `--print-streaming`

- Print streaming responses to console in real-time
- Useful for monitoring model responses during evaluation
- Bypasses normal logging to show immediate output

## Output Files

Results are automatically organized with timestamps for each evaluation run:

```text

        └── errors.log            # Error-only log with generation IDs
```

### Statistics Files

The framework generates comprehensive statistics files with failure tracking:

- **evaluation_statistics_*.json**: Tracks which models completed evaluation successfully
- **judge_statistics_*.json**: Tracks which models completed judging successfully
- **metrics_statistics_*.json**: Tracks which models were included/excluded from metrics

Each statistics file includes a `failure_lists` section that explicitly lists failed models for easy identification and debugging.

## Concurrency Configuration

The framework uses a dual-layer concurrency architecture:

```python
# config.py settings
class HLEConfig:
    num_workers: int = 3              # Inner concurrency: requests per model
    max_concurrent_models: int = 60   # Outer concurrency: simultaneous models
```

- **Outer Layer** (`max_concurrent_models`): Multiple models evaluated simultaneously
- **Inner Layer** (`num_workers`): Concurrent requests per model
- **Example**: `max_concurrent_models=5, num_workers=10` = up to 50 total concurrent API calls

## Architecture

The project uses a modular architecture:

- `hle/` - HLE evaluation framework
  - `runner.py` - Main orchestrator with dual-layer concurrency
  - `evaluation.py` - Individual model evaluation logic with resumable execution
  - `judge.py` - Automated scoring using judge models with structured response parsing
  - `dataset.py` - HLE dataset loading and question formatting
  - `statistics.py` - Comprehensive statistics generation with failure tracking
- `zenmux/` - ZenMux API integration
  - `api.py` - ZenMux API integration and model discovery
  - `client.py` - HTTP client with connection pooling
  - `models.py` - Data models for API responses and configurations
- `config.py` - Configuration management
- `benchmark.py` - Main CLI orchestrator
- `utils/` - Logging and utility functions

## Error Handling and Logging

The framework provides comprehensive error handling and logging:

- **Structured Logging**: Separate logs for different components with appropriate log levels
- **Error Tracking**: Detailed error logs with generation IDs for debugging
- **Failure Recovery**: Automatic retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- **Statistics Tracking**: Complete tracking of evaluation, judging, and metrics failures
- **Performance Metrics**: Detailed timing and throughput measurements
